## A* Pathfinding Algorithm

As another project for school I decided to try to implement my own version of the
[A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). It still has
lots of bugs and, I think, even fundamental Math Problems, but I'll keep on working :)

If you want to see a working version check out [Devon Crawfords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-YPj5Vt0oQ)
project.
