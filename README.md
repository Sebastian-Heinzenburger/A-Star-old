## A* Pathfinding Algorithm

As another project for school I decided to try to implement my own version of the
[A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). It still has
lots of bugs and, I think, maybe even a few fundamental Math Problems, but I'll keep on working :)

### Build 
```shell
$ javac com/sebastian/Main.java
$ java com.sebastian.Main
```
